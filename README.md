# Hotel-Data-Analysis
Analysis of hotel data in Microsoft Power BI

This project was done as a part of the CodeBasics Challenge. Files with "dim" are dimension tables, whereas files with "fact" are fact tables. "meta_data_hospitality" files give a description of each file.

The methodology for developing the dashboard for hotel data analysis entails the following stages:

1. Data Modeling: This initial phase involves structuring the data in a manner that is conducive to generating meaningful visualizations.
2. Data Cleansing and Extraction: This stage involved the cleaning of tables and the extraction of vital information from specific columns, such as the "week number."
3. Key Measures Definition: At this stage, we formulate "key measures" that are in line with the requirements and expectations of the stakeholders.
4. Visualization Selection and Dashboard Completion: The final stage involves choosing the most appropriate visualization technique for each measure, organizing measures, and finalizing the dashboard.
   
This systematic approach ensured the creation of a comprehensive and insightful dashboard that effectively communicates the key measures to stakeholders in the context of hotel data analysis.
